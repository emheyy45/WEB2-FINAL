        <p>PAX Rising showcases 
            engaging games developed 
            by smaller teams. The folks 
            at PAX believe these titles 
            have a chance to rise above 
            their modest beginnings, by 
            growing as a company, 
            establishing a fan base or 
            pushing the industry.
